### `components_attach_shelf`

This was supposed to be a branch of `attach_shelf` under a `checkpoint9`->[multiple packages] structure, which doesn't make sense.

Anyway, this is a rework of [attach_shelf](https://github.com/ivogeorg/attach_shelf.git) into ROS2 components. The requirements are in [checkpoint-10](assets/checkpoint-10.pdf).
